# breakout-game
This game was developed in CS50 introduction to game development course, This was the first game that I had learned in it about file management and I had modified on it since then, the only thing that I hadn't done in the assignment since then was the power ups as I had lost interest in lua and love2d and started learning a game engine since then and still learning it.

This project was made using LOVE2D 11.2
